Question
How did viewing a diff between two versions
of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Answer
In this case, the added line contained a typo,
so it was easy to locate the problem, go into 
the file and search for the offender.
However, if a bug had existed in a line that
had not been changed, the bug would not be as easy 
to detect.

Question
How could having easy access to the entire history of 
a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long
term?

Answer
Keeping track and having access to previously functional scripts
will allow for a quick "undo" feature in the event of 
a bug that could not be otherwise fixed. Also, sometimes the most
recent file could be accidentally misplaced or deleted. Having
past files saved in a different location could alleviate the
agony of starting over from scratch.

Question
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs. having versions 
automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Answer
The most obvious con is user-error. Sometimes the user may forget to make a commit, which may not be an issue if minimal changes have been made. However, when a lot of hours and changes have been made, lossing that information would be detrimental. The pro would be choosing when commiting would be relevant and meaningful.
